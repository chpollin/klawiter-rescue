# Stefan Zweig Bibliography - Application Documentation

## Overview

This single-page web application displays a comprehensive bibliography of Stefan Zweig's works. It provides an intuitive interface for exploring and searching the bibliography with features including categorization, filtering, and detailed entry views.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with separation of concerns:

```

│   └── styles.css          # Main stylesheet

```

## Core Components

### 1. Data Management (`data.js`)

The `ZweigBibliography` module handles loading and processing the bibliography data.

**Key Features:**
- Asynchronous loading of CSV data
- CSV parsing with support for quoted fields
- Data querying (filtering, searching)
- Metadata extraction (categories, languages, years, time periods)
- Event system for data loading notifications

**Primary Methods:**
- `loadData()` - Fetch and parse the CSV file
- `getAllEntries()` - Retrieve all bibliography entries
- `getEntryById()` - Find a specific entry by ID
- `searchEntries()` - Filter entries by query and filters
- `getCategories()`, `getLanguages()`, etc. - Get metadata for filtering

### 2. Routing (`router.js`)

The `ZweigRouter` module manages URL routing and browser history.

**Key Features:**
- Hash-based routing (#dashboard, #view=detail&id=123, etc.)
- Deep linking to specific views
- Browser history integration
- Route parameter parsing

**Primary Methods:**
- `initialize()` - Set up event listeners and handle initial route
- `navigate()` - Change routes programmatically
- `getCurrentRoute()` - Get current route state
- Helper methods like `navigateToCategory()`, `navigateToDetail()`

**Route Types:**
- Dashboard view: `#dashboard`
- List view: `#view=list&filter=category&id=Fiction`
- Detail view: `#view=detail&id=123`
- Search results: `#view=list&query=austria`

### 3. UI Management (`ui.js`)

The `ZweigUI` module handles the display and interaction with the user interface.

**Key Features:**
- View switching (dashboard, list, detail)
- Dashboard statistics and category tiles
- Search functionality
- Error and loading states

**Primary Methods:**
- `displayDashboard()` - Show overview with statistics and categories
- `displayEntries()` - Show filtered list of entries
- `displayEntryDetail()` - Show detailed view of a single entry
- `showLoading()`, `showError()` - Manage UI states

### 4. Templates (`templates.js`)

The `ZweigTemplates` module handles HTML rendering.

**Key Features:**
- Template-based rendering
- DOM manipulation for dynamic content
- Event handling for template interactions

**Primary Methods:**
- `renderBibliographyItem()` - Create entry card for the list view
- `renderEntryDetail()` - Create detailed entry view
- `renderFilterControls()` - Create filter UI

### 5. Main (`main.js`)

The application entry point that initializes components.

**Key Features:**
- Component initialization
- Event registration
- Error handling

## Views and Navigation Flow

### Dashboard View
- Overview statistics (total entries, categories, languages, etc.)
- Category tiles showing major work types
- Quick filters for popular languages and time periods

### List View
- Grid of bibliography entries based on current filters
- Entry cards showing title, year, category, and language
- Options to sort and filter results

### Detail View
- Complete entry information
- Original and translated titles
- Publication details
- Full bibliographic citation
- Navigation back to previous view

## User Interactions

1. **Dashboard Exploration**
   - View statistics about the bibliography
   - Browse major categories
   - Quick filter by popular languages or time periods

2. **Search and Filter**
   - Text search across all fields
   - Filter by category, language, year, or time period
   - Combine filters for specific results
   - Clear filters to see all entries

3. **Entry Navigation**
   - Click entry cards to view details
   - Navigate back to list or dashboard
   - Deep link sharing to specific entries

## Data Flow

1. Application initializes and loads CSV data
2. Router determines initial view based on URL
3. UI displays appropriate view (dashboard by default)
4. User interactions trigger route changes
5. Route changes trigger UI updates

## Event System

The application uses custom events for communication between modules:

- `loaded` - Data has been successfully loaded
- `error` - Error occurred during data loading
- `filter-changed` - User has changed a filter option

## Error Handling

- Network errors during data loading
- CSV parsing errors
- Missing entries when navigating directly to detail view
- Empty search/filter results

## Responsive Design

The application is responsive across devices:
- Grid layouts adjust based on screen size
- Navigation simplifies on smaller screens
- Touch-friendly controls for mobile devices

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
- Data visualization (timeline, category distribution)
- Export functionality (BibTeX, EndNote)
- User preferences (save favorite filters)
- Advanced search options
- Multilingual interface support

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient data structures for quick filtering
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- DOM manipulation optimizations in templates
- Browser caching for bibliography data
